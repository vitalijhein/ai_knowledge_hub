Collections of ideas and insights around specific topics and 
information that was previously located in [[Reading Notes]].

Not just random insights you have throughout the day, but condensed [[knowledge]] and brought into a bigger context.

Include notes from articles you've written so you can find common threads at a later date to link back to.

How?
- For each article, pull out 3-4 of the main concepts.
- Create a note for each one. 
- Link those notes back to a page created for each article.

Rules:
1. Keep these notes to the length of just a few tweets.
2. Each note should make sense by itself, without needing a ton of additional context.
3. Because these are “evergreen”, they should be relevant for a long, long time.

**Cross-Pollinate Ideas Across Different Domains**: 
Sometimes, great [[(MOC) Content]] ideas come from applying concepts from one field to another. Look for patterns, strategies, or innovations in other industries that could be adapted and applied to your niche in a fresh way.
