Instead of scrolling feeds all day, being intentional about your consumption can amplify the results.

You must become an intentional consumer to be a creator.
Which means you should be consuming [[(MOC) Content]] to create good [[(MOC) Content]]. 
- Writers read a lot of books. 
- Movie directors watch tons of movies.

If you’re not paying attention to what’s working, or what ideas resonate better online, it’s going to be quite hard to build an audience.

Caveat: The things you’re consuming need to be the right things. [[(MOC) Reading]] the news every day if you’re not creating around the topics in the news is not a great idea.

## Principles:
1. Curate your [[Content Sources]].
Be selective about where you get your information. Follow thought leaders, industry experts, and [[(MOC) Content]] creators who are at the forefront of their field. This ensures the quality of the [[(MOC) Content]] you're consuming and keeps you informed of the latest trends and methodologies.

2. Set Consumption [[(MOC) Goal]]: 
Identify what you want to achieve with the [[(MOC) Content]] you consume. Are you looking to improve your [[knowledge]] in a specific area, find inspiration for your own [[(MOC) Content]], or stay updated on industry trends? Having clear [[(MOC) Goal]] can help guide your [[(MOC) Content]] consumption choices.

3. Schedule Your Consumption Time - [[Information Discovery Mode]]
Rather than consuming [[(MOC) Content]] sporadically throughout the day, set aside dedicated time for it. This could be [[(MOC) Reading]] articles in the morning, listening to podcasts during your commute, or watching videos in the evening. By scheduling consumption, you're more likely to engage deeply with the [[(MOC) Content]] rather than skimming through it.

4. **Apply Critical Thinking**: 
Don't just consume [[(MOC) Content]] passively. Ask questions, make connections to what you already know, and think about how this new information can apply to your own work. This approach not only deepens your understanding but can also spark new ideas. Save the information into your [[Reading Notes]], later try to link it with your [[Evergreen Notes]].


5. **Quality Over Quantity**: 
In the digital age, the sheer volume of [[(MOC) Content]] available can be overwhelming. Prioritize quality over quantity by choosing [[(MOC) Content]] that is genuinely informative, thought-provoking, and relevant to your [[(MOC) Goal]]. This ensures that the time you spend consuming [[(MOC) Content]] is productive and beneficial to your creative process.
