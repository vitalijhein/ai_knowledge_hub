A common problem [[Why people don't write]] is that they [[Dislike Their Writing]].
1. They have concerns about the quality of their [[(MOC) Writing]].
2. They fear it may not be interesting or engaging enough. 
3. They worry about not making any progress, especially after considering life responsibilities.
4. They sometimes just end up deleting what they write because they think it's not good enough. 

A possible answer worth investigating further is:
- Self Deprecation is a "you problem" and it will never go away if you don't feel good about yourself.
- **Taking the Pressure off of the "Not good enough"**
	- change the perspective on not good enough.
	- trick:
		- think of your stories like a biography that you are commissioned by the protagonist to ghostwrite
		- doesn't matter if readers likes your
			- the person who actually wants the story written (the protagonist) needs to like it.
		- written in the way you want it to be written.
