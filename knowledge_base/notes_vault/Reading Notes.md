[[(MOC) Reading]] Notes are about what you are [[(MOC) Reading]] or [[(MOC) Learning]] currently. 
Can also be just random insights you have throughout the day.

You should collect those in a separate database than your [[Evergreen Notes]].

What are the benefits?
- Never start from a blank page when you start [[(MOC) Writing]].
- [[Smart Consumption]] is more effective when collecting information.

How can you use augment this process?
- You can use Readwise to highlight articles and books automatically into a notion db.
- Instead of simply highlighting things once and hoping to remember the context, this process allows to go back through those highlights and pull out further insights from re-[[(MOC) Reading]] the article or section of a book.
