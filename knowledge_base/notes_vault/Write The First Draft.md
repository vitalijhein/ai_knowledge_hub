Part of [[(MOC) Stages of Writing Routine]].

Start by taking your outline and [[(MOC) Writing]] the first sentences from it. You can always refer to the information from [[Evergreen Notes]], so you don't have to write from nothing, but better you do that in [[Edit your first draft]]

Try to write quickly, cut the fluff in the next step. 

You can always come back and polish things up later, the most important thing is to get it all on paper first. 

Think of it like a sketch. Just like can't expect yourself to draw the Mona Lisa with just a pencil, you can't expect yourself to write something perfectly the first time.

**Stop deleting what you write, even if you think it's bad.** I'd recommend giving [this short passage](https://wrd.as.uky.edu/sites/default/files/1-Shitty%20First%20Drafts.pdf) a read, I think you will find it helpful. "Shitty first drafts" are a necessary part of the process.

If you did a good job with the outline, and you are targeting something around 500-1000 words, **you can do it in an hour.
