Start by filtering/collecting your relevant notes from [[Reading Notes]] & [[Evergreen Notes]].

Previously I hadn't those notes setup, so I first dumped my research from [[How to Take Notes]] in a big document. 

Now this should be more straight forward.
[[Reading Notes]] need to be worked through and added to an outline document. 

Ideally those information are used to create new evergreen documents and create a outline structure like in [[How to Structure a Writing Routine]].

Go through your collection of [[Evergreen Notes]] and see if you can reuse any [[knowledge]] for your new [[content]].

Tips:
- **Always write an outline first.** 
- Spend 1h outlining.
- Avoid full sentences, outline - don't write.
	- Write in short rapid fire sentences. 
- Get the story down first, worry about the rest later. 
- Make each chapter a scene. Give each scene a purpose. End each scene with something that propels the reader into the next. 
- Your outline is ready when you can’t wait to write out every chapter in full.

Why outline:
- Make sure you know where you're going before you go there. 
- Think of listed notes in an outline as pitstops. 
- When you reach each pitstop, recoup and reflect.
- If you know where you're going, it's a lot easier to begin.
- Plot out the next scene and then, like all the professionals say, just write.

See this [[Example Outline]].
