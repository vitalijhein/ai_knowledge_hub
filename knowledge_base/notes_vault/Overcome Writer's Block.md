Try [[(MOC) Writing]] about anything, even if it seems silly.
- Chris advises, "If you're stuck, write about being stuck."
- Sometimes the best ideas come when you're not trying too hard.

The biggest block is You. 

Probably causing your block:
- often when starting to write seriously. 
- don't believe your [[(MOC) Writing]] will be "enough"
- putting weight on your own shoulders that doesn't need to be there. 
-> when you sit down to write, you're already in a self defeatist attitude. 


[[(MOC) Learning]] to write when things aren’t perfect is an immensely valuable skill rooted in discipline. If you can start to master this, you’ll unlock a whole world of possibilities for yourself.
 
Using fighter’s block (laptop) or danger notes (app on phone) has helped me a lot. 
- You can do sessions as short as two minutes and it makes you keep [[(MOC) Writing]] for the whole time you set (if you pause too long your character either gets defeated in battle in fighter’s block or your work disappears in danger notes). 
- I find that once I’ve written just a tiny bit, the rest is way easier, and it’s also helped me get past my perfectionism for first drafts. 
- I got about 1800 words in an hour and a half yesterday because I was typing as fast as my thumbs would let me

Play a brainstorm game whenever you have an ideas block. 
		- put on something weird on TV that I don't have to pay attention to
		- amalgamate concepts one after the other. 
		- Make them concepts that don't usually go together.
			- Mechanical Hippo
			- A man jumps through a keyhole
			- Biological screwdriver
			- The sweater spoke to me
			- Sky fish
		- keep playing games like that till you get an idea. 
		- combining main characters 
			- imagining what they would be like combined
			- putting characters into the plots of other books.
