How to discover and curate information to find interesting and relevant stories to share.

Consider splitting your notes into two category. [[(MOC) Reading]] Notes and Evergreen Notes.
- [[Reading Notes]]: Collection of temporary notes that are about what you are [[(MOC) Learning]] currently.
- [[Evergreen Notes]]: Collections of ideas and insights around specific topics.

Why?

When you have written hundreds of articles, **you can quickly forget all the information you’ve shared** before that would be relevant to an upcoming piece.

It helps to 
- Remember and find older information.
- Navigate [[Smart Consumption]].
- Link relevant information in a broader context. 

At any given time, you will have 15-20 potential drafts already started and have the highest amount of highlights and notes attached to them.

## Principles:
**Active Summarization**: 
Beyond highlighting, actively summarize the key points or insights from your readings in your own words. This practice enhances comprehension and retention, making it easier to recall and apply these ideas in your future work.

**Tagging and Categorization**: 
Implement a system of tags or categories in your database to organize your notes by topic, theme, source type, or any other relevant dimension. This makes it easier to find connections between different pieces of [[(MOC) Content]] and to pull relevant insights when working on a specific project.

**Schedule Review Sessions**: 
Periodically review your [[(MOC) Reading]] Notes to refresh your memory and to see if new connections or insights emerge with the passage of time or the acquisition of new [[knowledge]]. These sessions can also help in identifying which notes to evolve into Evergreen Notes.

**Use the Zettelkasten Method**: 
This method involves creating a network of linked notes where each note is connected to others in a meaningful way, enabling a web of [[knowledge]] that grows organically. Implementing this with your [[(MOC) Reading]] and Evergreen Notes can significantly enhance the depth and [[(MOC) Accessibility]] of your [[knowledge]] base.

**Share and Discuss**: 
Sharing your insights with a community or within a network can provide additional perspectives that you might not have considered. Discussion can also help in refining your thoughts and discovering new areas of interest.
