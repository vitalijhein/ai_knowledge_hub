#### Refactoring
- [ ] I have been [[(MOC) Writing]] refactoring for 3 months now
- [ ] this is the 17th issue - started bi-weekly, moved to weekly after the first month
- [ ] I strive to write essays, so actual original [[(MOC) Content]], almost every week

##### Against [[(MOC) Writing]]
- [ ] very few people write
- [ ] main reasons people say they dont write
- [ ] 1) It isnt really worth it (they dont say it out loud, but they believe it)
- [ ] 2) it takes too much time
- [ ] 3) I dont think i can write
#### It isnt really worth it
- [ ] [[(MOC) Writing]] has been one of the best decision i made this year
- [ ] it forced me to read and learn more about my practice
- [ ] It cleared my thoughts about such topics
- [ ] it expanded my network enormously - I met a lot of great people through it
- [ ] it could turn into a [[(MOC) Business]] someday ( examples)
