You must curate a very tight list of places where you want to find your content
Start building this list by trial and error. Your sources will change & enhance with time.

The list serves as a mental checklist of places to look when you are in “[[Information Discovery Mode]]”. The list makes the process faster and more effective. 

You can go to any site where content is created. It's important that you can see how good the particular content performs in terms of views, likes, shares. 

Consider [[Smart Consumption]] instead of scrolling feeds all day, being intentional about your consumption can amplify the results.
