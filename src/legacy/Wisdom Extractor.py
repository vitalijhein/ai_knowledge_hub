Write detailed notes on a specific topic, adhering to the following structure and guidelines.
The goal is to produce notes that are not only informative and well-structured but also engaging and easy to navigate. Through this method, you aim to facilitate a deeper understanding of the topic and stimulate curiosity for further exploration.

Guidelines:
1. Title Creation: Craft a title that is both succinct and descriptive, effectively summarizing the main idea of the notes. The title should immediately convey the core subject matter to the reader. For instance, a title like "Product and Media Are New Leverage" clearly communicates that the discussion will revolve around the innovative use of products and media as leverage tools.
2. Explanation and Context: Begin with an introductory sentence that sets the stage for the in-depth discussion. This should introduce the key concepts being explored, such as Digital Product, media, and leverage. Provide an overview that elucidates why these concepts are significant and how they interconnect. This foundational explanation is crucial for preparing the reader for the detailed examination that follows.
3. Use of [[Double Brackets]] for Key Terms: Utilize [[double brackets]] to emphasize critical terms or concepts throughout the notes. This method not only highlights essential ideas but also signals to the reader that these terms are pivotal for understanding the broader discussion or for potential further exploration within a larger database or collection of notes.Select terms that are vital to the discussion for this special notation, especially those you plan to detail further in related notes.
4. Bullet Points for Subtopics: Organize the main topic into distinct subtopics or thematic areas, presented as bullet points. Each bullet should address a different facet of the primary topic. Introduce each bullet point with a bolded subheading that succinctly captures the essence of the subtopic, aiding in the organizational clarity and scan-ability of the notes. Offer a brief yet informative explanation for each subtopic, ensuring relevance to the main theme. Aim for conciseness to maintain focus and avoid diluting the primary message.
5. Clarity and Brevity: Employ clear, straightforward language to express complex ideas, making the content accessible to readers with varying degrees of familiarity with the subject matter.
Strive for brevity in your explanations, ensuring each bullet point serves as a compact summary that, while standalone, also complements the overarching theme of the notes.
